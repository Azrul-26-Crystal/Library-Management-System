# Library-Management-System
Library management system to manage library transactions, books, users, and staffs using NodeJs and MySQL as database.

* In this project, we are to build a library management system using JavaScript, and MySQL as the database.

* The system should allow for CRUD operations for books,users and library transactions(lending/returning books)

* Library staffs have certain access limitation to their roles in the system. E.g. Admin can do library transactions, manage books, users and staffs. While librarian can only do library transactions, manage books and users.

* User passwords also need to be properly secured before being saved in the database by using hashing and salting.

* Lastly, proper documentation has been exposed via Swagger.js
